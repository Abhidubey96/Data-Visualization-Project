Description: 
The UEFA Champions League is an annual club football competition organized by the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) and contested by top-division European clubs, deciding the competition winners through a group and knockout format. It is one of the most prestigious football tournaments in the world and the most prestigious club competition in European football, played by the national league champions ( and, for some nations,  one or more runners-up) of their national associations.
For Data Visualization I am analyzing final matches played between teams from 1956 till 2017 also will going to find out so many hidden answers with using graph plots and tableau Dashboard.

Description of intended audience:
•	Football Teams, especially managers of team to identify the ranking and motivation for winning next title.
•	Common football fan to identify the best team in champions league history. Also ranking of teams based on goal scored and titles 
•	Champions league federation for statistics and history evaluation 

As per the finding there are few questions, we can answer in order to determine the best team:
Most scoring match played in champions league?
This will help us to understand which team is most competitive.
Which Team scores the greatest number of goals till date?
This will help us to understand which team is dominant.
When stadium is most occupied by people (outnumbered) and for which match?
This will help us to understand the popularity of team among people.
Most number of wins?
By analyzing above questions, we can definitely answer which team is most successful in terms of wins and popularity in champions league history.
